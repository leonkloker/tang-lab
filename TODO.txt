Meeting 02/13/2024:
* - Train ridge model with alpha = 0.1 on only 8 samples and their combinations and evaluate on the remaining eight
* - Subsample roughly 20% of cells of each sample and then train on 80% and test on the left-out test samples
* - Train SVM similar to linear regression model

Meeting 02/20/2024:
* - Include opacity values as features (divide the 5 higher-frequency amplitudes by the lowest frequency amplitude to get 5 additional features)
* - Ablation study for each feature: Remove one feature at a time and get the results of lasso regression model

Meeting 02/27/2024:
- Subsampling by splitting one sample into a train and test sample and then within each train / test sample
resample arbitrary amount of times and combine with other train / test samples to get augmented dataset
- Find out which feature have zero lasso-coefficient reliable throughout different train/test splits
- Get test error progression with larger amount of base datapoints to check if more data could be beneficial
(use first n base populations and split them into test and train, then test on their test parts as well as the remaining
N-n unused base populations)
- Look into PCA of the feature matrix to identify relevant features
- Fix ablation plot to include baseline model and only plot for lasso to see the importance (or use log-scale)
