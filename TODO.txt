Meeting 02/13/2024:
* - Train ridge model with alpha = 0.1 on only 8 samples and their combinations and evaluate on the remaining eight
* - Subsample roughly 20% of cells of each sample and then train on 80% and test on the left-out test samples
* - Train SVM similar to linear regression model

Meeting 02/20/2024:
* - Include opacity values as features (divide the 5 higher-frequency amplitudes by the lowest frequency amplitude to get 5 additional features)
* - Ablation study for each feature: Remove one feature at a time and get the results of lasso regression model

Meeting 02/27/2024:
* - Subsampling by splitting one sample into a train and test sample and then within each train / test sample
resample arbitrary amount of times and combine with other train / test samples to get augmented dataset
* - Find out which feature have zero lasso-coefficient reliable throughout different train/test splits
* - Get test error progression with larger amount of base datapoints to check if more data could be beneficial
(use first n base populations and split them into test and train, then test on their test parts as well as the remaining
N-n unused base populations)
* - Look into PCA of the feature matrix to identify relevant features
* - Fix ablation plot to include baseline model and only plot for lasso to see the importance (or use log-scale)

Meeting 03/05/2024:
* - Check if frequencies can be removed entirely (SVM close to zero more important than high activation performance)
* - Run pipeline on 203 and Avidin instead of CD63
* - Norm of coefficient vector vs amount of base datapoints in dataset 
* - UMAP or visualization of datapoints for paper purposes

Meeting 03/12/2024:
* - Fix dataloading such that Patient ID and activation is used
* - Rerun pipeline on new data
- UMAP on 10 important single cell features in 2d or 3d
* - Share the Github

Meeting 03/19/2024:
* - Fix cd203c normalization and bins
* - Try marginal feature pdf as features for simple model
* - Fix confusion matrix plot
(- try subsampling approach: Sample n cells from a sample where n is always fixed and
feed all the single-cell features into a model)
