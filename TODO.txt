Meeting 02/13/2024:
* - Train ridge model with alpha = 0.1 on only 8 samples and their combinations and evaluate on the remaining eight
* - Subsample roughly 20% of cells of each sample and then train on 80% and test on the left-out test samples
* - Train SVM similar to linear regression model

Meeting 02/20/2024:
- Include opacity values as features (divide the 5 higher-frequency amplitudes by the lowest frequency amplitude to get 5 additional features)
- Subsampling by splitting one sample into a train and test sample and then within each train / test sample
resample arbitrary amount of times and combine with other train / test samples to get augmented dataset
- Ablation study for each feature: Remove one feature at a time and get the results of lasso regression model
